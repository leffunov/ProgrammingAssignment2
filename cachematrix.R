## makeCacheMatrix creates a special matrix object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}

## cacheSolve computes the inverse of the special matrix. if the inverse has already been computed,
## then the function will retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
